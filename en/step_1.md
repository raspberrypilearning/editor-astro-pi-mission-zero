<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Red, Green and Blue</h2>

Computers often use three numbers to describe a colour. The numbers are between 0 and 255, for the amount of red, green, and blue.

```
hot_pink = (248, 24, 148)
```

In the code on the right, the colour (`c`) is set to black `(0, 0, 0)

Change the values of `c` and run the code to see what different colours you can make.
