<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Red, Green and Blue</h2>

Computers often use three numbers to describe a colour. These numbers are each between 0 and 255.
The first numbers is the amount of red, the second the amount of green, and the third the amount of blue.
White --> (255, 255, 255)
Black --> (0, 0, 0)

In the code on the right, the colour (`c`) is set to black.
Change the values of `c` and run the code to see what different colours you can make.
